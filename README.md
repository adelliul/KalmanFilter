1. Introduction 
This project demonstrates how a Kalman filter can be used to smooth noisy market price data. In this case, for futures contracts like ES (S&P 500), NQ (Nasdaq), or CL (Crude Oil).

Financial markets are full of noisy data, each price tick isn’t always meaningful. The Kalman filter acts like a smart averaging system that learns over time how much to trust new prices versus its current belief.
In trading terms:
The filter keeps track of a “fair value” estimate of the instrument.
Each time a new price tick arrives, it decides:
Should I move my estimate toward this new tick (if I think it’s real)?
Or should I ignore it a bit (if I think it’s just noise)?


This decision depends on how “trustworthy” the market data looks at that moment, captured by the Kalman Gain (K).


2. Concept Overview 
The Kalman filter works like a weighing system between two ideas:
What you already believe (prior estimate)
 → e.g., your current fair value for ES is 5050.0
What the market is showing you (new measurement)
 → e.g., a new tick at 5052.0


It combines both using a weighted average:
New Estimate=Old Estimate+K×(New Tick−Old Estimate)
Here, K (the Kalman Gain) decides how much to move:
If K is high, you trust the new tick and move a lot.
If K is low, you think it’s noise and move a little.


Over time, the filter keeps updating both:
the estimate of fair value
the confidence level (uncertainty)


This helps smooth prices and track trends more accurately than raw tick data
